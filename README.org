This is my vanilla Emacs configuration. It works for my purposes, feel free to modify it for your needs. The themes are from the =modus-themes= and =ef-themes= package made by [[https://protesilaos.com/emacs/ef-themes][Prot]].

I program in various languages for fun, so I have many different modes installed. If you would like to add your own, take a look at [[https://github.com/emacs-tw/awesome-emacs#programming-language][Awesome Emacs]]. It has many useful resources and packages to get started with.

** Screenshots
I tag my wallpaper based on theme. I pick a wallpaper and then select my Emacs theme that matches with it (Ex: forest wallpaper is good with =ef-cyprus=). In my [[https://github.com/BardofSprites/dotfiles-stow][desktop configuration]] for FVWM3 I created theme files that can be loaded through the menu. I also made Xresources themes for a majority of the ef and modus themes.

The following screenshots are themed with =modus-operandi-tinted=, because it was the theme I was when revising this README.
