This is my vanilla Emacs configuration. It works for my purposes, feel free to modify it for your needs. The themes are from the =modus-themes= and =ef-themes= package made by [[https://protesilaos.com/emacs/ef-themes][Prot]].

I program in various languages for fun, so I have many different modes installed. If you would like to add your own, take a look at [[https://github.com/emacs-tw/awesome-emacs#programming-language][Awesome Emacs]]. It has many useful resources and packages to get started with.

** Screenshots
I never use the same theme for an extended period of time, I just rotate through =modus= and =ef= themes depending on my mood for the day. The following screenshots are themed with =modus-operandi-tinted=, because it was the theme I was when revising this README.
